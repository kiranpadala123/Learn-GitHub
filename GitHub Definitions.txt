Version Control system address below two issues:-
------------------------------------------------
       1. Sharing
       2. Versioning

Version Control:-
---------------
      1. CVS  → Centralised Version Control System
      2. SVN → Centralised Version Control System
      3. GIT → Distributed Version Control System

Centralised vs Distributed:-
--------------------------
      1. Every thing happen in central place (SVN) so it is called centralised version control. 
      2. If SVN down, no way to communicate developers each other.
      3. Distributed system, you can create multiple copies

Git:-
----
A distributed version control system that tracks changes to files, allowing developers to collaborate on projects, revert to previous versions, and manage code effectively.
Open source

GitHub:-
-------
A web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides tools for collaboration, project management, and code sharing.

Configuring Git:-
---------------
      1. git config --global user.name "My Name"
      2. git config --global user.email. "someone@email.com"
      3. git config --list

Resolving Merge Conflicts:-
-------------------------
An event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits

Fork:-
----
Fork is nothing but you create entire copy of a original source and this way code is distribute.
