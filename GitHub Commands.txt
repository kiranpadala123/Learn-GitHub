Version Control system address below two issues:-
------------------------------------------------
       1. Sharing
       2. Versioning

Version Control:-
---------------
      1. CVS  → Centralised Version Control System
      2. SVN → Centralised Version Control System
      3. GIT → Distributed Version Control System

Centralised vs Distributed:-
--------------------------
      1. Every thing happen in central place (SVN) so it is called centralised version control. 
      2. If SVN down, no way to communicate developers each other.
      3. Distributed system, you can create multiple copies

Fork:-
----
Fork is nothing but you create entire copy of a original source and this way code is distribute.

Resolving Merge Conflicts:-
-------------------------
An event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits

Commands:-
--------
git branch
git checkout -b feature1
git checkout main
git branch
git checkout feature1
git branch
<p>This is a new repo.</p>
<p>This is a new feature</p>
git status
git add .
git commit -m  "Add new feature"
git status
git checkout main
git checkout feature1
git push origin feature1
git branch
git diff main
git checkout main
git branch
git pull origin main
